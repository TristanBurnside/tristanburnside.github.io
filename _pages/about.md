I am a software developer from Melbourne.

I work mostly with iOS and Objective-C but am also interested in other platforms and software architecture.

I have worked at Outware Mobile since 2014 as an iOS developer. Prior to this I was the lead (and only) Android developer at Trumpit Group Australia.

I studied a B.Eng(Robotics & Mechatronics) & B.Sci(Computer Science & Software Engineering) at Swinburne Universtity of Technology.
